# EDA-ATP-Data

In this project I have used a dataset of ATP data, which is suplimented with various other data gathered through web scraping pertaining to information related to the top tennis players over the century. I have used this data to perform a very basic data analysis and to visualise the results of this analysis using various graphics (matplotlib and seaborn plots).
