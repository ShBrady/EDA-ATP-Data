# EDA-ATP-Data

In this project I have used a dataset of ATP data, which is suplimented with various other data gathered through web scraping pertaining to information related to the top tennis players over the century. I have used this data to perform a very basic data analysis and to visualise the results of this analysis using various graphics (matplotlib and seaborn plots).

The fundamentals of this project are, data gathering (csv files and web scraping), data cleaning and error checking, storage of data, SQL queries to perform analyses, and visualisation.
